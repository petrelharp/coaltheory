\section{Allele frequencies: forwards time}

The processes described above keep track of what every individuals' genome is at each point in time.
Now, we need to compute something.
To get our hands on something concrete, consider the marginal process at a single nonrecombining locus.
suppose that there are two possible variants at this locus,
label them `0' and `1',
and denote the frequency of `1's in the population at time $t$ by $P_t$.
Also neglect the influence of mutation.
The change in this frequency is equal to the difference in aggregate numbers offsprings produced by individuals 
carrying each of the two variants,
divided by the population size.
If the locus is neutral
-- i.e.\ an organism's mate choice and offspring numbers are independent of the alleles carried --
then the average number of

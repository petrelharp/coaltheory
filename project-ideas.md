Ambitious suggestions for coding projects:
------------

+ Simulate with a "long-tailed" offspring distribution -- verify convergence to a Beta-coalescent, and investigate the transition between Kingman's and the Beta coalescent, perhaps as the upper bound on the possible number of offspring is increased.

+ Investigate empirical distribution within a fixed pedigree -- how much variation in coalescent time distributions are there between instantiations of recombination and segregation in a fixed pedigree?  Between pedigrees?
  see [Gene genealogies within a fixed pedigree, and the robustness of Kingman's coalescent.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22234858), by Wakeley, King, Low, and Ramachandran.

+ Investigate the bulk ("law of large numbers") behavior of a large number of lineages in a pedigree -- for instance, are the number of lineages present well-described by the deterministic (mean-value) equations?

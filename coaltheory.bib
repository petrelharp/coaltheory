  abstract = {Using a coalescent model of multiallelic balancing selection with recombination, the genealogical process as a function of recombinational distance from a site under selection is investigated. We find that the shape of the phylogenetic tree is independent of the distance to the site under selection. Only the timescale changes from the value predicted by Takahata's allelic genealogy at the site under selection, converging with increasing recombination to the timescale of the neutral coalescent. However, if nucleotide sequences are simulated over a recombining region containing a site under balancing selection, a phylogenetic tree constructed while ignoring such recombination is strongly affected. This is true even for small rates of recombination. Published studies of multiallelic balancing selection, i.e., the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of vertebrates, gametophytic and sporophytic self-incompatibility of plants, and incompatibility of fungi, all observe allelic genealogies with unexpected shapes. We conclude that small absolute levels of recombination are compatible with these observed distortions of the shape of the allelic genealogy, suggesting a possible cause of these observations. Furthermore, we illustrate that the variance in the coalescent with recombination process makes it difficult to locate sites under selection and to estimate the selection coefficient from levels of variability.},

  abstract = {The history of human population size is important for understand-
ing human evolution. Various studies1­5 have found evidence for a
founder event (bottleneck) in East Asian and European popula-
tions, associated with the human dispersal out-of-Africa event
around 60 thousand years (kyr) ago. However, these studies have
had to assume simplified demographic models with few parameters,
and they do not provide a precise date for the start and stop times of
the bottleneck. Here, with fewer assumptions on population size
changes, we present a more detailed history of human population
sizes between approximately ten thousand and a million years ago,
using the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent model applied
to the complete diploid genome sequences of a Chinese male (YH)6,
a Korean male (SJK)7, three European individuals (J. C. Venter8,
NA12891 and NA12878 (ref. 9)) and two Yoruba males (NA18507
(ref. 10) and NA19239). We infer that European and Chinese popu-
lations had very similar population-size histories before 10­20 kyr
ago. Both populations experienced a severe bottleneck 10­60 kyr
ago, whereas African populations experienced a milder bottleneck
from which they recovered earlier. All three populations have an
elevated effective population size between 60 and 250 kyr ago, pos-
sibly due to population substructure11. We also infer that the dif-
ferentiation of genetically modern humans may have started as early
as 100­120 kyr ago12, but considerable genetic exchanges may still
have occurred until 20­40 kyr ago.

@article{nielsen2009darwinian,
  abstract = {Past demographic changes can produce distortions in patterns of genetic variation that can mimic the appearance of natural selection unless the demographic effects are explicitly removed. Here we fit a detailed model of human demography that incorporates divergence, migration, admixture, and changes in population size to directly sequenced data from 13,400 protein coding genes from 20 European-American and 19 African-American individuals. Based on this demographic model, we use several new and established statistical methods for identifying genes with extreme patterns of polymorphism likely to be caused by Darwinian selection, providing the first genome-wide analysis of allele frequency distributions in humans based on directly sequenced data. The tests are based on observations of excesses of high frequency-derived alleles, excesses of low frequency-derived alleles, and excesses of differences in allele frequencies between populations. We detect numerous new genes with strong evidence of selection, including a number of genes related to psychiatric and other diseases. We also show that microRNA controlled genes evolve under extremely high constraints and are more likely to undergo negative selection than other genes. Furthermore, we show that genes involved in muscle development have been subject to positive selection during recent human history. In accordance with previous studies, we find evidence for negative selection against mutations in genes associated with Mendelian disease and positive selection acting on genes associated with several complex diseases.},

  abstract = {The amount of genome-wide molecular data is increasing rapidly, as is interest in developing methods appropriate for such data. There is a consequent increasing need for methods that are able to efficiently simulate such data. In this paper we implement the sequentially Markovian coalescent algorithm described by McVean and Cardin and present a further modification to that algorithm which slightly improves the closeness of the approximation to the full coalescent model. The algorithm ignores a class of recombination events known to affect the behavior of the genealogy of the sample, but which do not appear to affect the behavior of generated samples to any substantial degree.We show that our software is able to simulate large chromosomal regions, such as those appropriate in a consideration of genome-wide data, in a way that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing coalescent algorithms.This algorithm provides a useful resource for those needing to simulate large quantities of data for chromosomal-length regions using an approach that is much more efficient than traditional coalescent models.},

  abstract = {We address a conceptual flaw in the backward-time approach to population genetics called coalescent theory as it is applied to diploid biparental organisms. Specifically, the way random models of reproduction are used in coalescent theory is not justified. Instead, the population pedigree for diploid organisms--that is, the set of all family relationships among members of the population--although unknown, should be treated as a fixed parameter, not as a random quantity. Gene genealogical models should describe the outcome of the percolation of genetic lineages through the population pedigree according to Mendelian inheritance. Using simulated pedigrees, some of which are based on family data from 19th century Sweden, we show that in many cases the (conceptually wrong) standard coalescent model is difficult to reject statistically and in this sense may provide a surprisingly accurate description of gene genealogies on a fixed pedigree. We study the differences between the fixed-pedigree coalescent and the standard coalescent by analysis and simulations. Differences are apparent in recent past, within ≈ <log(2)(N) generations, but then disappear as genetic lineages are traced into the more distant past.},

All the information about  ancestry is contaned in this graph.
 The sample DNA lengths have marginal ancestral trees at each point in [0,1] which are imbedded in the graph.  An upper bound is found for the number of distinct most recent common ancestors of these trees, and the expected minimum waiting time to these ancestors.},

@article{mcvean2009genealogical,
  abstract = {Genetic variation in natural populations typically demonstrates structure arising from diverse processes including geographical isolation, founder events, migration, and admixture. One technique commonly used to uncover such structure is principal components analysis, which identifies the primary axes of variation in data and projects the samples onto these axes in a graphically appealing and intuitive manner. However, as the method is non-parametric, it can be hard to relate PCA to underlying process. Here, I show that the underlying genealogical history of the samples can be related directly to the PC projection. The result is useful because it is straightforward to predict the effects of different demographic processes on the sample genealogy. However, the result also reveals the limitations of PCA, in that multiple processes can give the same projections, it is strongly influenced by uneven sampling, and it discards important information in the spatial structure of genetic variation along chromosomes.

It is found that the equations describing this process are simple modifications of the equations describing the process assuming that the two loci are completely linked. Thus, the statistical properties of the genealogical process for a random sample at a neutral locus linked to a locus with selection follow from the results obtained for the selected locus. Sequence data from the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) region of Drosophila melanogaster are examined and compared to predictions based on the theory. It is found that the spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between Fast and Slow alleles of Adh is very similar to the spatial distribution predicted if balancing selection operates to maintain the allozyme variation at the Adh locus. The spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between different Slow alleles of Adh do not match the predictions of this simple model very well.},

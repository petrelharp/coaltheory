  abstract = {This paper describes a model of a gene as a continuous length of DNA represented by the interval [0,1].  The ancestry of a sample of genes is complicated by possible recombination events, where a gene can have two parent genes.
  An analogue of Kingman's coalescent process, in which the ancestry of a sample of genes at a single locus is described by a stochastic binary tree, is a stochastic ancestral recombination graph, with vertices wehre coalescent or recombination events occur.  All the information about  ancestry is contaned in this graph.
 The sample DNA lengths have marginal ancestral trees at each point in [0,1] which are imbedded in the graph.  An upper bound is found for the number of distinct most recent common ancestors of these trees, and the expected minimum waiting time to these ancestors.},

@article{mcvean2009genealogical,
  abstract = {Genetic variation in natural populations typically demonstrates structure arising from diverse processes including geographical isolation, founder events, migration, and admixture. One technique commonly used to uncover such structure is principal components analysis, which identifies the primary axes of variation in data and projects the samples onto these axes in a graphically appealing and intuitive manner. However, as the method is non-parametric, it can be hard to relate PCA to underlying process. Here, I show that the underlying genealogical history of the samples can be related directly to the PC projection. The result is useful because it is straightforward to predict the effects of different demographic processes on the sample genealogy. However, the result also reveals the limitations of PCA, in that multiple processes can give the same projections, it is strongly influenced by uneven sampling, and it discards important information in the spatial structure of genetic variation along chromosomes.

@article{mcvean2002genealogical,
  abstract = {The degree of association between alleles at different loci, or linkage disequilibrium, is widely used to infer details of evolutionary processes. Here I explore how associations between alleles relate to properties of the underlying genealogy of sequences. Under the neutral, infinite-sites assumption I show that there is a direct correspondence between the covariance in coalescence times at different parts of the genome and the degree of linkage disequilibrium. These covariances can be calculated exactly under the standard neutral model and by Monte Carlo simulation under different demographic models. I show that the effects of population growth, population bottlenecks, and population structure on linkage disequilibrium can be described through their effects on the covariance in coalescence times.},

@article{hudson1988coalescent,
  abstract = {The statistical properties of the process describing the genealogical history of a random sample of genes at a selectively neutral locus which is linked to a locus at which natural selection operates are investigated. It is found that the equations describing this process are simple modifications of the equations describing the process assuming that the two loci are completely linked. Thus, the statistical properties of the genealogical process for a random sample at a neutral locus linked to a locus with selection follow from the results obtained for the selected locus. Sequence data from the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) region of Drosophila melanogaster are examined and compared to predictions based on the theory. It is found that the spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between Fast and Slow alleles of Adh is very similar to the spatial distribution predicted if balancing selection operates to maintain the allozyme variation at the Adh locus. The spatial distribution of nucleotide differences between different Slow alleles of Adh do not match the predictions of this simple model very well.},
